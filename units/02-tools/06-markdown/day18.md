# Markdown + GitHub Exercise

For class today, I'd like you to complete a task using Markdown and GitHub.

## Exercise

By Monday, I want you to share (either via DM or in `#01-discussion` on Slack) a link to a GitHub repo with containing, at minimum, the following:

1. An image file
2. A `Readme.md` that contains:
  * At least one **Heading Level 1**
  * At least one **Heading Level 2**
  * At least one **Link** to an external website
  * At least one **Bulleted or Numbered List** with at least three items
  * The image file (above) displayed as an **Image**

How you complete this task is up to you, though [this is your chance to test out the software you plan on using in the future](https://engl460.slack.com/files/U6SFBKTB5/F7CQDP1C0/Stuff_to_Download).
