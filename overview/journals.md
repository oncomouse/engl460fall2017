# Journal Entries

Here is a list of each journal entry along with the date on which they are due on Slack.

## Journal Entry 1 – 09.06.2017

### Part I: Reflect

How does Slack compare to the Memex? More generally, how does your experience of computers compare with what Vannevar Bush is talking about? Do you think Bush helps us think about digital writing?

### Part II: Apply

Where else do you see yourself using Slack? Has it or Bush's essay changed the way you think about writing on a computer? What have you learned to do cool on Slack that we haven't talked about yet?

## Journal Entry 2 – 09.13.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Are all texts multimodal? What if I told you they were. Would you believe me? Why or why not? Given that this syllabus is mostly a block of text written in a style roughly corresponding to a technical document, how would you describe it's multimodality? How would an essay be multimodal? If everything is multimodal, why is "multimodal" a useful concept?

### Part II: Apply

Find a Twitter or Tumblr account you enjoy. Use the five modes to analyze how that user is making arguments about who they are as a person. Include a link to the account in question in your journal entry. You may also write about Slack, if you prefer.

## Journal Entry 3 – 09.20.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Do Lanham and Manovich's optimism about the ability for computerized writing to reshape and extend learning, inquiry, and creativity seem born out now that we are reading this years later? Why or why not? Where do you think this optimism comes from? Is there any new technology today that you see people being similarly excited about?

### Part II: Apply

Thinking about Manovich and Lanham, what kinds of texts could you imagine making with the affordances of the computer? What do Manovich and Lanham leave out?

## Journal Entry 4 – 09.27.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Are video games art? Are they writing? Why or why not? Use the texts we have been discussing in this unit in your discussion as evidence in your argument.

### Part II: Apply

What is a video game you have encountered that seems to make a particular argument? If you have a favorite game that you think does not make an argument, can you consider it more in depth and analyze its argument?

## Journal Entry 5 – 10.04.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Do you find that collaborative writing does or might imply different strategies for writing? If so, what do you do to manage collaborative writing? If not, why not?

### Part II: Apply

How do you imagine using collaborative tools for your final project? How have you used these tools in the past? What projects could you imagine doing with them?

## Journal Entry 6 – 10.11.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Markdown does two things:

1. Simplifies document structure
1. Abstracts HTML

The first thing makes the structure of a document more apparent. The second makes the materiality of the document more abstracted. Is this a good trade-off? Does it matter?

### Part II: Apply

Slack has Markdown enabled in the post editor. Write your entry in Markdown. Try to incorporate some links, lists, and images. How do you like writing in Markdown? Does it change how you plan your entries?

## Journal Entry 7 – 10.18.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Many blogging platforms, such as Wordpress, are powered by what is called a [relational database system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). These databases are industrial-strength tools for sorting, storing, and finding information. Jekyll is an important piece of software in that it allows blogging without the need for a DB to be maintained as part of the writing process. This is why Jekyll is referred to as a "static site generator."

However, I'm wondering as you start using Jekyll, maybe even playing around with blogging on it, does Jekyll still end up conforming to Manovich's ideas of "the database" as a cultural form. If so, does this help you better understand online writing?

### Part II: Apply

What have you done on Jekyll? What do you want to investigate further?

## Journal Entry 8 – 10.25.2017

### Part I: Reflect

We've worked with two very different digital narratives this week: *Keep Tradition Secure* and games made with [Twine](https://twinery.org). Compare and contrast the two approaches to digital narrative, paying special attention to the way both use the affordances of the digital and whether these uses are effective.

### Part II: Apply

We saw the educational example on Wednesday, but do you imagine other contexts, beyond games, in which Twine might be useful? If so, what would those be? If not, why do you think Twine is mostly about making games?

## Journal Entry 9 – 11.01.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Now that we have studied several different digital technologies, which do you prefer and why? Do you find that this preference is due to having a specific final project in mind? Or because you think in a particular way?

### Part II: Apply

What kind of argument do you want to make with your final project? What kinds of technologies will you use to do this? What kind of technologies will you have to investigate, that we have not covered, that you might need? Consider this a first draft of your project proposal. This journal entry may be particularly useful for finding a group for your final project, as well.
